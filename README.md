# simple-whisper
The repository is focused on the automatic speech recognition (ASR) system called Whisper, developed by OpenAI. The ASR system is trained on a massive dataset consisting of 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web. The use of such a large and diverse dataset leads to improved robustness to accents, background noise and technical language, and enables transcription in multiple languages, as well as translation from those languages into English.  

You can find the  accompanying article [here](https://openai.com/research/whisper).  

The repository provides a simple and easy-to-use Python interface for running the Whisper ASR system. It also contains a Google Colab notebook that allows users to run the model in the cloud for free, without the need for any local installation.  

The repository contains detailed documentation on how to install and use the model, as well as examples of how to perform transcription and translation tasks. The codebase is open-source and can be used as a foundation for building useful applications and for further research on robust speech processing.
